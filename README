dhcprelya is a lightweight DHCP relay agent written for Yandex company for
high loaded routers with tens interfaces and thousands hosts behind them.

It's fast, independed from any side libraries, and it does not turn on
a promisc mode for listening interfaces. Plugins supported. With plugins
you can implement any functionality. A command line options is compatible
with ISC dhcrelay but extended.

Some ideas was taken from Edwin's dhcprelay (net/dhcprelay in ports collection.
which unfortunately has some shortages) and dhcpdump (net/dhcpdump).

It's distributed under BSD license.

HOW TO RUN
There are two syntax. The first one is a ISC dhcrelay compatible:

dhcprelya [-d] [-p<pidfile>] -A <packet_size> -c <hops_count>
	-i<if1>... -i<ifN> <server1>... <serverN>

-i	- an interfaces list that should be listened.
server	- a servers list where request will be forward to.
-A	- set maximum packet size. Default: 1400. It's more then enough.
-c	- When hops counter in a DHCP packet more then this value,
	  the packet is dropped. It prevets loops. Defaul: 10.

A second one allows to use a configuration file:

dhcprelya [-d] [-p<pidfile>] -f <config.file>

Common options are:
-d	- do not demonize and output debugging info onto terminal.
-p	- use not default pid file. You can run more than one copy of
	  dhcprelya with different pid files.

See dhcprelya.conf-example for format.

If an interface does not exist on this host, it'll be ignored. It's useful
for only one config file for all routers with logical interfaces (vlanNN etc.).

Any questions, bug reports and feature requests are welcome.
