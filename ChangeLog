dhcprelya v5.1 (Release date: 2017-03-01)
==============

Changes:

* Remove obsolated print_ip(), print_mac() functions. inet_ntop() and
  ether_ntoa_r() do good work.
* Add IP binding for client interfaces. In case when there are many IP
  addresses present on interface we can now specify an IP address on which
  we want to listen. (xornet@yandex-team.ru)
* Rework get_ip(). We never need net mask there. Specify prefered (bind) IP
  instead.
* Compute UDP checksum. iPXE rejects DHCP packets without it. (azryve@yandex-team.ru)
* Add a struct of headers with #pragma pack for future use.
* Rename a struct with confusing name 'header' to 'pcap_header'.
* log_plugin: print ether type in Client-ID. Print it as string if type==0.

* radius_plugin: Put MAC address into RAD_CALLING_STATION_ID too, it should be
  there, not in username. (lytboris@yandex-team.ru)
* Log bpf writing failures. (lytboris@yandex-team.ru)
* Increase SERVER_MAX value to 64. (lytboris@yandex-team.ru)
* Fix CC warnings. (xornet@yandex-team.ru)
